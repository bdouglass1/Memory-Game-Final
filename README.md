# Memory-Game-Final
Udacity Memory Game Project
This is a memory game developed using html, css, and javascript. Thru use of the DOM, cards react as the player selects which cards to turn over. The game is completed once all cards are matched. The star rating, number of moves, and time will be displayed at the very end on a modal.
