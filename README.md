# Memory-Game-Final
Udacity Memory Game Project
This is a memory game developed using html, css, and javascript. Thru use of the DOM, cards react as the player selects which cards to turn over. The game is completed once all cards are matched. The star rating, number of moves, and time will be displayed at the very end on a modal. 

select cards and try to match as many of them as possible and as quickly as possible. 

The game is won when all cards have been matched. A congratulations modal will appear and will display the player's total number of moves, star rating, and the time recorded to complete the game. The game will reset once the player closes the modal.

At any time the game can also be reset by clicking the reset icon.

Bootstrap and google fonts were integrated (awesome, coda).
